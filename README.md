# PyBer_analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
In the PyBer project, we are are working with data in CSV files for our new job at PyBer. We want to visualize the data that we are provided with. In order to do so, we will be using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook. We want to look at the relationship between the number of drivers, number of rides, the type of city, and the fares of the rides. This way, we are able to help Pyber how to give riders better access while keeping it affordable.

### Tools used in the project
**Jupyter Notebook** 

## Results:

### Differences in city type data with 
* total rides, drivers, fares
When it comes to total rides, it makes sense that the majority of the rides are from Urban cities. This could possibly be due to demographics in each type of city but that cannot be assumed with the data given. Just like the total number of rides, the majority of the drivers are in Urban cities. This makes sense as the larger the popular is in a city, the chances of more drivers would increase. The Urban cities once again leads another category with the highest amount fares.

* average fare per ride and driver
With the average fare per rides and drivers, the Urban cities have the lowest averages. With the average fare per rides, the prices are not far apart with the average Rural fare being shy of $35 while the average Urban fare being under $25. However, the average fair per drivers is not close. The difference between Urban and Suburban is around $23. Between Suburban and Rural is $14.

## Summary:

After looking at the results from the data, three recommendations I would have for the CEO would be
* 1. Convince Urban drivers to pick more rides in Rural and Suburban cities
 When looking at the data, there are more rides than drivers in Rural and Suburban cities. However, there are about 800 more drivers in the Urban cities. If some of the Urban drivers are able to get some riders in the less populated areas, it can possbily increase the number of rides in those areas.

* 2. Try to decrease the average fare per ride
Even though this can cut into profits for PyBer, if the average price for less populated areas decreased, riders in those areas might choose to use PyBer which would increase the number of rides.

* 3. Convince riders in less populated areas to use PyBer (advertisement)
Assuming that the total drivers in the area and the price per ride is not the problem for solving the disparities, the best way to increase ridership in the less populated areas would be for advertisement. This way, those potential riders would know they can use PyBer as an alternative for taking trips.
